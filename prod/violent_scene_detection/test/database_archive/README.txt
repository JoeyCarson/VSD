The files in this directory are preindexed database backups.  
They can be used to overwrite the current default_training_set.xml without performing the arduous task of indexing all of the videos again.
Ideally, eventually the tool should support passing a parameter to the given file, but it's not implemented at the moment.

default_training_set_1.xml was created running the tool given dataset_index_input_1.txt.
